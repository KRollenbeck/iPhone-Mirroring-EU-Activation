# iPhone Mirroring Activation in the EU

clone this repository in the terminal with 
> clone https://github.com/KRollenbeck/iPhone-Mirroring-EU-Activation.git

import the MacOS Shortcut with
> https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e6c85ade827441f9a7f672c3207159f4

Now you have to follow the Shortcuts Setup steps (adding the path to your python file)

For the Shortcut to work you either have to give full disk Access to the Shortcuts App

OR

You can add this Shortcut to the Dock. This creates a Shortcutname.app file in your Applications folder. You can also give full disk access to this app (safer method). With this method you have to start the Shortcut via the Shortcutname.app

Now instead of opening the regular iPhone Mirroring App, you run the Shortcut / Shortcut.app and this should modify the "eligibility.plist" file and open the Apple iPhone Mirroring App.

## For this to work you need at least Python 3.10 installed 

## AND

## Your Apple Account on your iPhone for "Media & Purchases" have to be outside of the EU. (You can just setup a new one)
